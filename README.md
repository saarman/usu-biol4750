# usu-biol4750
A place for students to go to look at records from live coding examples and notes.

# Example Lab Portfolios  
- This is Where Norah will save notes from live coding examples in class, and serves as an example of the portfolio entry you will turn in for all/nothing credit in Canvas.
 - "Save As..." to create a copy of this file with your name/initials, and then fill in the gaps to keep track of your coding, thoughts, and learning.
   
## Lab 1: Review of R Skills 9/3/2024
 - lab01-NPS-example.Rmd (lab01-NPS-example.md is the knitted version)
 - Following along from <https://bookdown.org/hhwagner1/LandGenCourse_book/basic-r.html>
 - Create an Rmd log entry that provides the code from:
 - **a. Section 2.1 Basic R Programming** (you can mostly copy and paste and add comments)
 - **b. Section 2.2 R Graphics** (you can mostly copy and paste and add comments)
 - At the end, export your work as .Rmd/.txt/.md/etc from RStudio, and submit to Canvas for credit and feedback. Ask for help if you need it!

## Lab 2: Importing Genetic Data 9/10/2023
 - lab02-NPS-example.Rmd  (lab02-NPS-example.md and lab02-NPS-example.pdf are the knitted versions)  
 - Following along from <https://bookdown.org/hhwagner1/LandGenCourse_book/WE_1.html>
 - Create an Rmd log entry that provides the code from:
 - **a. Section 4.3 Worked Example** (you can mostly copy and paste and add comments, 4.3.5 and on is OPTIONAL)
 - **b. Section 4.4 R exercise Week 1** (you will need to write your own code using knowledge from Section 4.3)
 - At the end, **knit it to a pdf or md file**, export from RStudio, and submit to Canvas for credit and feedback. If there are error messages during knitting, check the ‘R Markdown’ tab for the code line number and try to fix it. Ask for help if you need it!

## Lab 3: Genetic Diversity 9/17/2024  
 - lab03-NPS-example.Rmd (lab03-NPS-example.md and lab03-NPS-example.pdf are the knitted versions)
 - Following along from <[https://bookdown.org/hhwagner1/LandGenCourse_book/WE_1.html](https://bookdown.org/hhwagner1/LandGenCourse_book/WE_3.html#WE_3)>
 - Create an Rmd log entry that provides the code from:
 - **a. Section 6.3 Worked Example** (you can mostly copy and paste and add comments)
 - **b. Section 6.4 R exercise Week 3** (you will need to write your own code using knowledge from Section 6.3)
 - At the end, **knit it to a pdf or md file**, export from RStudio, and submit to Canvas for credit and feedback. If there are error messages during knitting, check the ‘R Markdown’ tab for the code line number and try to fix it. Ask for help if you need it!
